#


[listen]

#
# Set the interface on which SAC will listen for source address announcements.
# By default, the interface used to communicate with the default gateway is
# used.
#
# NOTE: This setting is ignored if route.gateway is not set.
#
#interface = 'eth0'

#
# Set the UDP port on which SAC will listen for source address announcements.
# Default value is 4242.
#
#port = 4242

#
# Set the multicast address on which SAC will listen for source address
# announcements.  Default value is '239.255.42.42'.
#
#address = '239.255.42.42'


[route]

#
# Sets the destination addresses used to auto-detect the default route.  No
# traffic is sent to this address; it is only used to query the kernel routing
# table.  Default value is '8.8.8.8'.
#
# NOTE: This setting is ignored if route.gateway is set.
#
#destination = '8.8.8.8'

#
# Sets the "gateway" address, which is normally the local default gateway.
# Unless it is running in "insecure" mode (-I), SAC will ignore source address
# announcements that do not come from this address.  By default, this value is
# auto-detected.
#
#gateway = '172.31.255.254'

#
# Sets the UDP source port.  Unless it is running in insecure mode (-I), SAC
# will ignore source address announcements from a different source port.  The
# default value is 42.
#
#source_port = 42


[plugins]

#
# A list of Python modules that contain SAC plugins to be loaded.
#
modules = [ 'sac.plugins.he_dns' ]

#
# A list of Python source files that contain SAC plugins to be loaded.  The
# module name of the file will be its "base name," without any path or
# extension.  For example, '/foo/bar/baz.py' will be loaded as a module named
# 'baz'.  The modules will be loaded in a "virtual package" named
# '_sac_file_plugins_', so the fully qualified module name of the loaded
# '/foo/bar/baz.py' file will be '_sac_file_plugins_.baz'.
#
# NOTE: This plugin loading mechanism is intended for development and testing
# only.  plugins.modules is the preferred mechanism for loading plugin modules.
#
files = [ '/my/plugin/directory/ast_pjsip.py' ]


[plugin.he-dns]

# The plugin class.  The key/value pairs in this section will be passed to the
# plugin instance's __init__() method as its cfg argument (a Python dictionary).

class = 'sac.plugins.he_dns.HEDNSPlugin'

#
# The username used to authenticate to the Hurricane Electric dynamic DNS API.
#
username = '********'

# The DDNS key used to authenticate to the Hurricane Electric dynamic DNS API
# when updating this record.
#
password = '****************'

#
# The hostname for which the DNS record should be updated.

hostname = 'example.com'

#
# The nameservers used to check the current DNS record.  (SAC will not modify
# DNS record if it already matches the source address.)

[plugin.asterisk]

#
# The plugin class.  Note that the fully qualified module name has been
# generated from the "virtual package" (_sac_file_plugins_) and the base name of
# the Python file (ast_pjsip).
#
class = '_sac_file_plugins_.ast_pjsip.AsteriskPJSIPPlugin'

#
#conf_file = '/home/pilcher/Projects/sac/pjsip.conf'

#
# Directory where updated PJSIP configuration and "reload flag" files are
# written.  Creating the reload flag file triggers a separate systemd service to
# copy the updated pjsip.conf file into place and reload the Asterisk
# configuration.  (See asterisk-pjsip-reload.path and
# asterisk-pjsip-reload.service.)  Default value is '/run/sac_ast_pjsip'.
#
# NOTE: This setting has no effect if reload_flag_file and new_conf_file are
# both set.
#
#state_dir = '/run/sac_ast_pjsip'

#
# Path to the reload flag file.  Default value is
# ${state_dir}/pjsip_reload_needed (normally
# '/run/sac_ast_pjsip/pjsip_reload_needed').
#
# NOTE: See state_dir for a description of the purpose of the reload flag file.
#
#reload_flag_file = '/run/sac_ast_pjsip/pjsip_reload_needed'

#
# Path where the updated pjsip.conf file is written.  Default value is
# constructed from the value of state_dir and the file name (without its path)
# of conf_file (normally '/run/sac_ast_pjsip/pjsip.conf').
#
# NOTE: See state_dir for a description of the purpose of this file.
#
